## Common things

There are three different variable types that are supported. Integers (signed), [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) strings for text and [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded byte arrays for binary data.

## File extensions

CommonSecret file should have file extension chain that explains how it should be opened. e.g. *foods.commonsecret.xml* would mean that CommonSecret is stored to XML format, and *fruits.commonsecret.json.png* would mean that CommonSecret is stored to JSON which is then stored to PNG image file.

## Mandatory parts

### Version number

This **MUST** be first element (and this is only element where order matters). Contains an integer that tells what CommonSecret version this file uses. Currently there is only version 1.

## Data parts

### Key derivation functions (KDF)

List of text objects that define key derivation functions. There can be multiple Key derivation functions defined in one CommonSecret file.

#### KDF Algorithms

Only [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) is supported, with **HMAC-SHA256** and **HMAC-SHA512** 

##### PBKDF2 options

###### Salt

Base64 encoded salt, decoded content should be 16 bytes (128 bits)

###### Iterations

Integer that tells how many iterations have to be done. Minimum value is 1, recommended is

#### Identifier

Identifier of KDF, used to pair KDF and Symmetric-key algorithm. Base64 encoded UTF-8 string. SHOULD be unique, so every KDF in a file should have unique identifer.

&nbsp;

### Login informations

Login information (plaintext ones). Every variable MUST be included even if they are empty.

#### Title

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string, used to identify entries (doesn't need to unique)

#### Address / URL

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string, might contain e.g. HTTPS URL

#### Username

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string

#### Password

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string

#### Notes

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string, additional notes for this entry

#### Creation time

Integer, [UNIX timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in seconds

#### Modification time

Integer, [UNIX timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in seconds

#### Icon

Base64 encoded byte array that contains either [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) or [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) image file as logo

#### Category

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string

#### Tags

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string that contains tab (**\t**) separated tag entries

#### Checksum

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string that contain SHA-256 checksum of all other login information variables concatenated together

&nbsp;

### Login informations (secret)

Encrypted entries, each entry MUST contain following:

#### Key identifier

Key identifier is used to pair one KDF entry to this login information

#### Algorithm

See [Symmetric-key algorithms](Symmetric-key-algorithms)

#### Data

### Symmetric-key algorithms

Two encryption algorithms are supported, they are [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (CTR) and [ChaCha20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant).

#### AES (CTR)
