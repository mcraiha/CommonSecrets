## Common things

There are three different variable types that are supported. Integers (signed), [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) strings for text and [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded byte arrays for binary data or text.

Basically all hardcoded strings (e.g. enum likes) are stored as UTF-8. Anything that user can input (e.g. URL) is stored as base64 encoded byte array (so UTF-8 string is converted to bytes and then base64 encoded). This decision is made in name of interoperability (so one can e.g. copy values from JSON to XML and everything should just work).

## File extensions

CommonSecrets file should have file extension chain that explains how it should be opened. e.g. *foods.commonsecrets.xml* would mean that CommonSecrets is stored to XML format, and *fruits.commonsecrets.json.png* would mean that CommonSecrets is stored to JSON which is then stored to PNG image file.

## Mandatory parts

### Version number

This **MUST** be first element (and this is only element where order matters). Contains an integer that tells what CommonSecrets version this file uses. Currently there is only version 1.

## Data parts

### Key derivation functions (KDF)

List of text objects that define key derivation functions. There can be multiple Key derivation functions defined in one CommonSecrets file.

#### KDF Algorithms

Only [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) is supported, with **HMAC-SHA256** and **HMAC-SHA512** as pseudo-random functions.

##### PBKDF2 options

###### Salt

Base64 encoded salt, decoded content should be 16 bytes (128 bits)

###### Iterations

Integer that tells how many iterations have to be done. Minimum value is 1, recommended is something over 100 000

#### Identifier

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string as identifier of KDF, used to pair KDF and Symmetric-key algorithm. SHOULD be unique, so every KDF in a file should have unique identifer.

&nbsp;

### Login informations

Login information (plaintext ones). Every variable MUST be included even if they are empty.

#### Title

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string, used to identify entries (doesn't need to unique)

#### Address / URL

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string, might contain e.g. HTTPS URL

#### Username

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string

#### Password

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string

#### Notes

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string, additional notes for this entry

#### Creation time

Integer, [UNIX timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in seconds

#### Modification time

Integer, [UNIX timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in seconds

#### Icon

Base64 encoded byte array that contains either [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) or [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) image file as logo

#### Category

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string

#### Tags

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string that contains tab (**\t**) separated tag entries

#### Checksum

UTF-8 string (can only contain hex chars, so numbers 0-9 and letters A-F) that contain SHA-256 checksum of all other login information variables concatenated together

&nbsp;

### Login informations (secret)

Encrypted entries, each entry MUST contain following:

#### Key identifier

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string Key identifier is used to pair one KDF entry to this login information

#### Algorithm

See [Symmetric-key algorithms](Symmetric-key-algorithms)

#### Data

Base64 encoded byte array that contains encrypted [AUDALF](https://github.com/mcraiha/AUDALF) bytes. AUDALF contains following entries:

##### Title

UTF-8 string, used to identify entries (doesn't need to unique)

##### Address / URL

UTF-8 string, might contain e.g. HTTPS URL

##### Username

UTF-8 string

##### Password

UTF-8 string

##### Notes

UTF-8 string, additional notes for this entry

##### Creation time

64 bit unsigned integer, Unix time in seconds (see type ID **117440513** in AUDALF specifications)

##### Modification time

64 bit unsigned integer, Unix time in seconds (see type ID **117440513** in AUDALF specifications)

##### Icon

Byte array that contains either [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics), [PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics) or [JPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG) image file as logo

##### Category

UTF-8 string

##### Tags

UTF-8 string that contains tab (**\t**) separated tag entries

#### Checksum

UTF-8 string (can only contain hex chars, so numbers 0-9 and letters A-F) that contain SHA-256 checksum of all other login information secret variables concatenated together

&nbsp;

### Symmetric-key algorithms

Two encryption algorithms are supported, they are [AES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) (CTR) and [ChaCha20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant).

#### AES (CTR)

Name is **AES-CTR**

Following values must be included

##### Key size

Integer, valid values are 128, 192 or 256 (bits)

##### Initial counter

Base64 encoded byte array that contains 128 bits of nonce used to init AES-CTR

#### ChaCha20

Name is **ChaCha20**

Following values must be included

##### Key size

Valid integer value is 256 (bits)

##### Nonce

Base64 encoded byte array that contains 96 bits of nonce used to init ChaCha20

##### Counter

Integer value that contains counter that is used to init ChaCha20

&nbsp;


### Notes
