## Common things

There are three different variable types that are supported. Integers (signed), [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8) strings for text and [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) encoded byte arrays for binary data or text.

Basically all hardcoded strings (e.g. enum likes) are stored as UTF-8. Anything that user can input (e.g. URL) is stored as base64 encoded byte array (so UTF-8 string is converted to bytes and then base64 encoded). This decision is made in name of interoperability (so one can e.g. copy values from JSON to XML and everything should just work).

## File extensions

CommonSecrets file should have file extension chain that explains how it should be opened. e.g. *foods.commonsecrets.xml* would mean that CommonSecrets is stored to XML format, and *fruits.commonsecrets.json.png* would mean that CommonSecrets is stored to JSON which is then stored to PNG image file.

## Mandatory parts

### Version number

This **MUST** be first element (and this is only element where order matters). It is first element because it is easier to check file formats when needed information is as early as possible. 

Version number is an integer that tells what CommonSecrets version this file uses. Currently there is only version **1**.

## Data parts

### Key derivation functions (KDF)

List of text objects that define key derivation functions. There can be multiple Key derivation functions defined in one CommonSecrets file.

#### KDF Algorithms

Only [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) is supported, with **HMAC-SHA256** and **HMAC-SHA512** as pseudo-random functions.

##### PBKDF2 options

###### Salt

Base64 encoded salt, decoded content should be 16 bytes (128 bits)

###### Iterations

Integer that tells how many iterations have to be done. Minimum value is 1, recommended is something over 100 000

#### Identifier

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string as identifier of KDF, used to pair KDF and Symmetric-key algorithm. SHOULD be unique, so every KDF in a file should have unique identifer.

---

### Login informations

Login information (plaintext ones). Every variable MUST be included even if they are empty.

#### Title

#### Category

Base64 encoded UTF-8 string

#### Tags
